Terraform: Install the latest version from here.

Azure CLI: Set up and authenticate using az login.

An active Azure subscription.

üì• How to Use

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/aryanInfra/Terraform-Automation.git  
cd Terraform-Automation

2. Initialize Terraform

terraform init

3. Customize Variables

Update the variables.tf file or create a terraform.tfvars file with your configurations:

resource_group_name = "my-resource-group"  
location = "East US"  
vm_size = "Standard_DS1_v2"  
admin_username = "azureuser"  
admin_password = "your_password_here"

4. Plan the Deployment

terraform plan

5. Apply the Configuration

terraform apply

6. Destroy Resources

To remove all created resources, run:

terraform destroy


‚ö† Important Notes

Ensure the terraform.tfstate file is stored securely as it contains sensitive information.

Test all configurations in a non-production environment before deployment.

Follow Azure's security best practices for network and virtual machine configurations.
